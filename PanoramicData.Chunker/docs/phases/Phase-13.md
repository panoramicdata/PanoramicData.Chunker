## Objective

Extract semantic relationships beyond simple co-occurrence using dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and domain-specific patterns.

---

## Tasks

### 23.1. Dependency Parsing ? PENDING

- [ ] Research NLP library options (Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy)
- [ ] Implement `DependencyRelationshipExtractor`
- [ ] Subject-verb-object triple extraction
- [ ] Relationship type inference from verbs
- [ ] Multi-sentence relationship handling

### 23.2. Coreference Resolution ? PENDING

- [ ] Implement `CoreferenceResolver`
- [ ] Pronoun resolution ("he" ? "John Doe")
- [ ] Synonym detection
- [ ] Entity mention tracking across chunks

### 23.3. Domain-Specific Extractors ? PENDING

- [ ] `TechnicalRelationshipExtractor` (implements, calls, inherits_from)
- [ ] `BusinessRelationshipExtractor` (employed_by, reports_to)
- [ ] `LegalRelationshipExtractor` (party_to, governs)

### 23.4. Pattern-Based Extraction ? PENDING

- [ ] Implement `PatternRelationshipExtractor`
- [ ] Regex pattern library
- [ ] Confidence scoring
- [ ] Custom pattern support

### 23.5. Testing ? PENDING

- [ ] 60+ unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Precision/recall benchmarks

---

## Deliverables

- `DependencyRelationshipExtractor` class
- `CoreferenceResolver` class
- Domain-specific extractors (3+)
- 60+ tests
- Documentation

---

## Success Criteria

? Extract 5+ relationship types automatically  
? 70%+ precision on relationship extraction  
? Handle cross-sentence relationships
