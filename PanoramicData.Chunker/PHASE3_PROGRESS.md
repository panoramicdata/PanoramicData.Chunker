### 3.3. Token Counter Factory ? COMPLETE
- [x] Implemented `TokenCounterFactory` static class
- [x] `Create()` method for creating counters by method
- [x] `GetOrCreate()` method for working with ChunkingOptions
- [x] Support for all TokenCountingMethod enum values
- [x] Proper error messages for unsupported methods (Claude, Cohere)

**File Created**: `PanoramicData.Chunker/Infrastructure/TokenCounterFactory.cs`

**Factory Methods**:
```csharp
// Create by method
var counter = TokenCounterFactory.Create(TokenCountingMethod.OpenAI_CL100K);

// Get from options
var counter = TokenCounterFactory.GetOrCreate(options);
```

### 3.4. Comprehensive Testing ? COMPLETE
- [x] 32 unit tests for `OpenAITokenCounter`
- [x] 12 unit tests for `TokenCounterFactory`
- [x] All tests passing (44/44 = 100%)
- [x] Test coverage for all encoding types
- [x] Test coverage for splitting algorithms
- [x] Test coverage for edge cases and error handling

**Files Created**:
- `PanoramicData.Chunker.Tests/Unit/TokenCounters/OpenAITokenCounterTests.cs` (32 tests)
- `PanoramicData.Chunker.Tests/Unit/Infrastructure/TokenCounterFactoryTests.cs` (12 tests)

**Test Categories**:
- Encoding creation tests (4 tests)
- Token counting accuracy tests (8 tests)
- Async operation tests (2 tests)
- Splitting algorithm tests (10 tests)
- Error handling tests (4 tests)
- Factory method tests (8 tests)

### 3.5. Build Status ? SUCCESS
- [x] All code compiles successfully
- [x] Zero build warnings
- [x] All 280 tests passing (236 existing + 44 new)

## Remaining Tasks ??

### 3.3. Other Token Counters (Deferred)
- [ ] Research Claude tokenization (Anthropic)
- [ ] Implement `ClaudeTokenCounter` (if API available)
- [ ] Research Cohere tokenization

**Status**: Marked as NOT SUPPORTED in factory with clear error messages

### 3.5. Update Chunk Splitting (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Markdown chunker already uses ITokenCounter
- [ ] Update HTML chunker to accept ITokenCounter

  - [ ] Re-run HTML tests with OpenAI token counting
  - [ ] Verify chunk sizes are within limits
  - [ ] Test preset configurations with real documents
  - [ ] Compare character-based vs OpenAI token counts

### 3.7. Documentation - Token Counting (PENDING)
- [ ] Document token counting options in README
- [ ] Explain differences between token counting methods
- [ ] Provide guidance on choosing the right method
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
- [ ] Create code examples
- [ ] Update MasterPlan with completion status

3. **Update ChunkerFactory** to use TokenCounterFactory when creating chunkers
4. **Documentation** - Write comprehensive guide on token counting
5. **Performance Testing** - Compare performance of different token counters
6. **Benchmarking** - Add token counting benchmarks

## Technical Highlights

### OpenAI Token Counter Implementation

The implementation uses SharpToken library which provides:
- **Accurate Tokenization**: Matches OpenAI's official token counts
- **Multiple Encodings**: Support for CL100K, P50K, and R50K
- **Efficient Splitting**: Splits at actual token boundaries, not approximations
- **Overlap Support**: Maintains context with configurable token overlap

### Token-Based Splitting Algorithm

```
1. Encode entire text to tokens
2. If under max tokens, return as-is
3. Calculate stride = maxTokens - overlap
4. Split tokens into batches of maxTokens
5. Decode each batch back to text
6. Apply overlap between consecutive batches
```

**Benefits**:
- No mid-word splits
- Preserves semantic boundaries
- Accurate chunk sizing for embedding models
- Consistent results across runs

### Factory Pattern

The `TokenCounterFactory` provides:
- **Centralized Creation**: Single place to create all token counters
- **Options Integration**: Works seamlessly with `ChunkingOptions`
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new token counter types
- **Error Messages**: Clear guidance when unsupported methods are requested

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Claude & Cohere**: Not yet implemented (marked as NOT SUPPORTED)
2. **Caching**: Token counting caching not yet implemented
3. **HTML Chunker**: Doesn't yet use token counter (still uses character estimates)
4. **Performance**: Token counting is CPU-bound, may need optimization for very large documents

## Lessons Learned

1. **SharpToken Integration**: Straightforward and works well
2. **Factory Pattern**: Makes it easy to add new token counters
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests caught encoding issues early
4. **API Design**: Static factory methods provide clean, intuitive API

**Next Session**: Complete integration with HTML chunker and add comprehensive documentation.

**Estimated Completion**: 60% remaining (1-2 more sessions)
